0:00:05.279,0:00:09.499
laughable calendar

0:00:09.499,0:00:10.859
especially you

0:00:10.859,0:00:11.879
uh... store

0:00:11.879,0:00:14.900
uh... i'd fall of two hundred and
subscribers and i'm quite happy about

0:00:14.900,0:00:15.879
that

0:00:15.879,0:00:19.579
but uh... how you get to having to look
at that website uh... every time of

0:00:19.579,0:00:23.699
uh... you too can to see what how many
people are there other

0:00:23.699,0:00:27.400
indeterminate people subscribe kamikaze
sold

0:00:27.400,0:00:30.279
value videos and i would like to
automate these

0:00:30.279,0:00:35.750
so i looked at the a_p_ i did that uh...
you'd regret we will provide for rent

0:00:35.750,0:00:39.160
and and i've just want to write a small
state control

0:00:39.160,0:00:43.850
to fact today till and then uh... do we
do that do something to that

0:00:43.850,0:00:47.490
the first thing about this and i don't
know the

0:00:47.490,0:00:52.540
distraught reporters he was also able to
get psychological provide even more

0:00:52.540,0:00:57.190
uh... click on the download link and
there i get to the that pop cultural

0:00:57.190,0:00:59.190
repro package that fits

0:00:59.190,0:01:04.820
vostro peripheral blood type of the i_d_
and some other softly was i installed

0:01:04.820,0:01:06.770
byron it's uh...

0:01:06.770,0:01:08.590
through referral

0:01:08.590,0:01:12.300
popular and i'll have that you are
ordered

0:01:12.300,0:01:14.149
well all this does not endorse the

0:01:14.149,0:01:17.630
artists or producers or most create
their own

0:01:17.630,0:01:19.380
and so forth widespread

0:01:19.380,0:01:21.270
uh... because i prefer to

0:01:21.270,0:01:23.900
writes someone pro-life tightening

0:01:23.900,0:01:24.740
changer

0:01:24.740,0:01:27.960
diversion number in august twenty cents
of it

0:01:27.960,0:01:31.630
of a source for five ten

0:01:31.630,0:01:34.620
and uh... i see descriptive just for a

0:01:34.620,0:01:36.720
let's take a week you troop

0:01:36.720,0:01:41.090
you to do it if you don't know about the
doesn't do anything yet

0:01:41.090,0:01:43.300
we have to meet the needs some kind of
uh...

0:01:43.300,0:01:46.900
group to get there to get to you today

0:01:46.900,0:01:49.360
and debating that is that

0:01:49.360,0:01:51.500
this election right my old

0:01:51.500,0:01:53.770
access to the f_b_i_ but to go to

0:01:53.770,0:01:55.940
assertion jingles

0:01:55.940,0:01:59.100
saw so i'll go to mexico and of course

0:01:59.100,0:02:02.180
which is a university directories

0:02:02.180,0:02:04.430
since it's it's uh... it says that

0:02:04.430,0:02:08.319
so i think he could get rid of that that
how they are not google thodi pumpkin

0:02:08.319,0:02:09.709
ron service it out

0:02:09.709,0:02:11.639
the better for like five years

0:02:11.639,0:02:15.709
and but they've looked like anemic city
search engine for seat on the retrieval

0:02:15.709,0:02:17.110
data recorder

0:02:17.110,0:02:22.119
the modules said that are mercy music
for

0:02:22.119,0:02:26.199
and then let me try to access to troops
who are attacking you too

0:02:26.199,0:02:27.549
uh...

0:02:27.549,0:02:28.879
and it'll give me

0:02:28.879,0:02:30.479
various results

0:02:30.479,0:02:34.879
in the stored on the list of text live
door at probys enrolling for me

0:02:34.879,0:02:39.109
and there is a victory seed to that some
syndrich senior

0:02:39.109,0:02:44.119
uh... so let's see what the step two

0:02:44.119,0:02:48.849
i clicked on that's wrong

0:02:48.849,0:02:53.099
it says uh... always that if this will
support warned that the c_p_i_ about

0:02:53.099,0:03:00.099
that's not what you want to let's go
back and look for

0:03:00.230,0:03:04.289
let's sit this one does this quick
pretty cold

0:03:04.289,0:03:06.540
uh... that's it just won't well

0:03:06.540,0:03:09.959
this is the striking a let's see what
the this through

0:03:09.959,0:03:16.689
sources yet sorry speedy trial you too

0:03:16.689,0:03:22.709
that story p_i_ version too it sounds
okay

0:03:22.709,0:03:26.859
double real easy to a meeting dot that's
awesome vessels to dilate

0:03:26.859,0:03:29.249
called eventually transferred

0:03:29.249,0:03:32.120
i can write to uh... used underneath the
bridge

0:03:32.120,0:03:33.149
assault

0:03:33.149,0:03:36.879
less tolerance to eliminate some of the
way we can do it

0:03:36.879,0:03:39.709
is uh... take uh...

0:03:39.709,0:03:41.599
the name of the module

0:03:41.599,0:03:44.789
then they go to the store brand new

0:03:44.789,0:03:47.529
strobe referral tools

0:03:47.529,0:03:50.839
and and there is a sitcom play

0:03:50.839,0:03:53.449
reaches not repeat

0:03:53.449,0:03:58.059
hope because i already have one so i
don't have opened

0:03:58.059,0:04:02.249
what you need to do is install

0:04:02.249,0:04:03.319
install

0:04:03.319,0:04:05.610
and then copy paste the name of the
module

0:04:05.610,0:04:12.610
and once you're on this and press enter
into a jaldi module and installment

0:04:13.349,0:04:14.849
actually in minority

0:04:14.849,0:04:20.269
installed under the screw off and you
will see it's running trying to test it

0:04:20.269,0:04:22.479
view test of the module

0:04:22.479,0:04:24.249
and that they got cancelled

0:04:24.249,0:04:28.889
so once it's installed a cat does so i
won't get the this

0:04:28.889,0:04:30.180
next the

0:04:30.180,0:04:31.199
doesn't start

0:04:31.199,0:04:34.629
and let's talk radical with them

0:04:34.629,0:04:38.449
what i can see there i go to the
synopsis and bias

0:04:38.449,0:04:41.080
it just makes an important issue

0:04:41.080,0:04:44.189
sell all loaded with decently

0:04:44.189,0:04:48.169
unload the the module itself in memory

0:04:48.169,0:04:49.539
uh...

0:04:49.539,0:04:52.409
need to create an orange ect alone

0:04:52.409,0:04:53.830
this

0:04:53.830,0:04:58.540
uh... actually this is using did a lot
schoolday i'm indirect uh...

0:04:58.540,0:04:59.520
but of course

0:04:59.520,0:05:02.860
that small treaty the recommended me to
use its so instead of putting the new

0:05:02.860,0:05:04.220
key word here or

0:05:04.220,0:05:06.309
which is not the issue of the two
methods

0:05:06.309,0:05:07.800
cooled by put his

0:05:07.800,0:05:09.580
the this way

0:05:09.580,0:05:12.130
i think is better

0:05:12.130,0:05:16.770
stuart retarded object uh... dolomite
teaches us

0:05:16.770,0:05:18.219
youtube object

0:05:18.219,0:05:22.679
and uh... namecard operative videos
that's what interesting for me

0:05:22.679,0:05:27.969
what i would like to look to get testy

0:05:27.969,0:05:34.859
jets user

0:05:34.859,0:05:39.660
get user profile keep snowfall this is
what i need get user profile

0:05:39.660,0:05:42.550
so i just by being

0:05:42.550,0:05:45.330
wide t_v_

0:05:45.330,0:05:46.919
user

0:05:46.919,0:05:48.099
profile

0:05:48.099,0:05:50.139
and then he says

0:05:50.139,0:05:54.370
uh... optionally i can give the name of
the user or i have to be built in our

0:05:54.370,0:05:57.190
own people being so

0:05:57.190,0:06:02.059
target destroyed european varied
username might have on you too

0:06:02.059,0:06:02.759
and

0:06:02.759,0:06:06.550
headed up to the return when you do

0:06:06.550,0:06:09.569
profile insisted there be able to make

0:06:09.569,0:06:14.360
and um... between returned at least user
profile in stone so let's see what's in

0:06:14.360,0:06:15.639
there

0:06:15.639,0:06:21.710
and details and information about
abolished me for example so let's see

0:06:21.710,0:06:26.319
so let's say

0:06:26.319,0:06:29.249
about

0:06:29.249,0:06:33.190
and that's from tuzla sore throats that
five to run this code

0:06:33.190,0:06:38.259
and the so it's not until after posting
a speaker and that's the advanced

0:06:38.259,0:06:39.919
so that's why they are

0:06:39.919,0:06:41.810
about whatever it's called

0:06:41.810,0:06:43.489
neutral terms

0:06:43.489,0:06:47.499
and so grave that's working

0:06:47.499,0:06:48.789
presentation of

0:06:48.789,0:06:54.190
uh... and then uh... let's see what else
can i get

0:06:54.190,0:06:57.629
statistics of probably i needed to send
this to its

0:06:57.629,0:07:00.110
uh... celeste

0:07:00.110,0:07:01.489
with it to your

0:07:01.489,0:07:04.519
unum

0:07:04.519,0:07:09.280
rizky object to a best wishes to

0:07:09.280,0:07:10.250
but is it too

0:07:10.250,0:07:13.960
so i get the profile from the profile i
get the statistics

0:07:13.960,0:07:18.769
so from that for for still just sticks

0:07:18.769,0:07:21.049
writes this is holly's father yet

0:07:21.049,0:07:25.330
and then formed a right contingent all
the

0:07:25.330,0:07:27.740
from the statistics that you can see

0:07:27.740,0:07:30.159
there if you come for example

0:07:30.159,0:07:32.849
the union

0:07:32.849,0:07:35.439
candidates ran into the game

0:07:35.439,0:07:36.220
this goes to

0:07:36.220,0:07:41.570
into two branch of the date and that's
the view comments probably right

0:07:41.570,0:07:43.809
uh... does their own buffalo grove

0:07:43.809,0:07:45.900
all three of you saw the channel

0:07:45.900,0:07:47.700
at subscriber account

0:07:47.700,0:07:50.669
ten so although it is better to take
over the past

0:07:50.669,0:07:52.160
so i wanted to let me

0:07:52.160,0:07:55.620
typos so this is the edge

0:07:55.620,0:08:00.160
subscriber clones and then

0:08:00.160,0:08:03.270
today and what role

0:08:03.270,0:08:09.169
this is i don't know why there is a
space heroes

0:08:09.169,0:08:13.119
and see if you don't want to come

0:08:13.119,0:08:19.139
that's probably the total called the
police constable any of my videos can be

0:08:19.139,0:08:23.090
neustine awards or whatever records at
five

0:08:23.090,0:08:23.879
and uh...

0:08:23.879,0:08:28.229
blue that's keeps me zero personal
carino right

0:08:28.229,0:08:34.440
uh... what two hundred is good so
they're under subscribers

0:08:34.440,0:08:37.110
total upload too so that's why the
dreadful

0:08:37.110,0:08:41.490
except that it has spaces here are the
latest displayed incorrectly or

0:08:41.490,0:08:44.420
they all of the data hold the cold war

0:08:44.420,0:08:46.360
actually there is a typo in there

0:08:46.360,0:08:47.880
documentation

0:08:47.880,0:08:51.710
so uh... i can visit and because
underscores the restored

0:08:51.710,0:08:53.430
it must be there

0:08:53.430,0:08:55.440
display

0:08:55.440,0:08:58.910
slowly for you and i don't need this

0:08:58.910,0:09:02.050
for children to watch that what's the
rule for me

0:09:02.050,0:09:05.970
and here we are taxed almost seven
thousand we need a couple of poor people

0:09:05.970,0:09:06.949
and then

0:09:06.949,0:09:07.950
it's gonna be

0:09:07.950,0:09:09.460
overdraft

0:09:09.460,0:09:14.950
soul okay so i have always said data of
the uh... we'll try to resist

0:09:14.950,0:09:19.420
so let's say says so that i saw an email

0:09:19.420,0:09:21.220
costs on the menu

0:09:21.220,0:09:25.790
uh... how do i do that so i'd go back to

0:09:25.790,0:09:28.900
blair s and uh...

0:09:28.900,0:09:31.470
so i don't want to send it to gmail

0:09:31.470,0:09:35.530
contract in june of interest or some
sort of them would you want

0:09:35.530,0:09:38.410
doesn't help me and said you know i'm
upbeat

0:09:38.410,0:09:41.120
that's not the general

0:09:41.120,0:09:43.620
gmail s_ and t_ p_g_ meal

0:09:43.620,0:09:44.560
that sounds good

0:09:44.560,0:09:47.190
okay so lasts a

0:09:47.190,0:09:49.130
cooperatives this one

0:09:49.130,0:09:50.100
well lou

0:09:50.100,0:09:56.160
afternoon silly because i already did it
is so you have to do something

0:09:56.160,0:10:00.360
does like it on the on the link and
they're going to lose the guy who wrote

0:10:00.360,0:10:02.000
it i don't know if they are

0:10:02.000,0:10:03.880
happening

0:10:03.880,0:10:08.830
civil war here is a synopsis time need
to use it to use the module to go to

0:10:08.830,0:10:09.630
memory

0:10:09.630,0:10:10.529
deadman

0:10:10.529,0:10:13.930
connected to those servers logan and
prosper

0:10:13.930,0:10:14.660
and them

0:10:14.660,0:10:16.930
while it was something else so

0:10:16.930,0:10:19.490
let's go because this one

0:10:19.490,0:10:20.350
uh...

0:10:20.350,0:10:22.990
yeah your

0:10:22.990,0:10:25.530
and then find needs all that

0:10:25.530,0:10:27.660
persons

0:10:27.660,0:10:30.270
is gmail and uh... login

0:10:30.270,0:10:34.080
i'm going to use this looking a grocer
downpour

0:10:34.080,0:10:34.879
years

0:10:34.879,0:10:36.420
five two nine

0:10:36.420,0:10:41.690
uh... and then the cost for well this is
the password only google

0:10:41.690,0:10:44.030
google

0:10:44.030,0:10:46.240
we're going to be a plus mel

0:10:46.240,0:10:52.920
uh... and then i'm going to send to
myself so we did see gmail

0:10:52.920,0:10:54.850
youths

0:10:54.850,0:10:57.440
category five two nine

0:10:57.440,0:11:01.870
so the subject is city you choose

0:11:01.870,0:11:03.220
of this

0:11:03.220,0:11:09.260
perot's okay let's be very bows and the
text so the text should be so let's put

0:11:09.260,0:11:11.630
it very difficult facts here

0:11:11.630,0:11:16.690
and and and at that shimon probably
don't have an attachment theory yet so

0:11:16.690,0:11:18.870
transformed the songs

0:11:18.870,0:11:22.040
and this was a text

0:11:22.040,0:11:22.959
text

0:11:22.959,0:11:25.619
