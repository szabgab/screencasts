that then faculty pitted against our
religion

0:02:16.230,0:02:17.900
and here is the frozen bubble

distance citizens here decompress
interview memorial service

0:02:33.910,0:02:36.080
control the world and also on the issue

0:02:36.080,0:02:38.949
since two training detained

honolulu jose roseanne

0:02:42.199,0:02:46.629
disciples delegates in return

0:02:46.629,0:02:49.599
really good

0:02:49.599,0:02:53.709
i'm proud of yourself

0:02:53.709,0:02:54.550
let's level

0:02:54.550,0:02:57.610
so i think that you're quite a long time

0:02:57.610,0:03:03.729
enjoys the remote but i think uh...
elections has selected this

0:03:03.729,0:03:05.779
hello

0:03:05.779,0:03:09.429
so i could just given all would like to
show you the number of

0:03:09.429,0:03:13.869
and that is uh... seattle here as well
it's good to me is

0:03:13.869,0:03:15.259
reaches there

0:03:15.259,0:03:19.839
became uh... more here in that regard as
fred had to go and the result is running

0:03:19.839,0:03:23.129
out for you and you have to let them go

0:03:23.129,0:03:28.349
really whole also people

0:03:28.349,0:03:30.759
dissatisfied with your right hand

0:03:30.759,0:03:35.069
and so we go up to you decision to move
towards peace

0:03:35.069,0:03:39.329
you have to deal with that placing from
some resistance can be different

0:03:39.329,0:03:44.069
not creating continues literature
features you can just stay abreast

0:03:44.069,0:03:47.889
receiving pittsburgh depressed and
restarted it

0:03:47.889,0:03:49.179
and then move then you can

0:03:49.179,0:03:51.629
process you can do to his pizza

0:03:51.629,0:03:53.420
that's gotta be fun for everyone

0:03:53.420,0:03:56.010
how do we want to to make changes

0:03:56.010,0:03:59.390
then that is open source so you can make
them to do to get help

0:03:59.390,0:04:00.589
repository

0:04:00.589,0:04:03.359
and uh... start fixing it uh...
lovelovelove

0:04:03.359,0:04:05.569
knows what the right kind of recruiting

0:04:05.569,0:04:06.330
at one point

0:04:06.330,0:04:07.639
mid-eighteen can

0:04:07.639,0:04:09.129
speaking daily chores

0:04:09.129,0:04:10.729
and you know

0:04:10.729,0:04:12.359
and

0:04:12.359,0:04:14.329
so what else is here

0:04:14.329,0:04:17.969
attention there is an interesting
feature of all for object

0:04:17.969,0:04:21.949
so progress is going to hear is the new
version zero point eighty six is going

0:04:21.949,0:04:23.990
to be pretty sick quite soon

0:04:23.990,0:04:27.810
uh... in a couple things that need to
have a new feature that's extremely

0:04:27.810,0:04:31.979
surprising for anyone is using proving
the last four years

0:04:31.979,0:04:34.569
so far enough as a major issue of
progress

0:04:34.569,0:04:35.960
that he didn't have koresh

0:04:35.960,0:04:39.240
sickness highlighting for redefined or

0:04:39.240,0:04:41.090
stuff came up to five ten

0:04:41.090,0:04:46.699
and and that the reason is is because we
were using the central editorial egypt

0:04:46.699,0:04:48.389
and that you had a tear

0:04:48.389,0:04:51.899
invader and because we were using the
media would really love it

0:04:51.899,0:04:56.800
for a long story issues through w
percent bindings and so on

0:04:56.800,0:04:58.840
so because of that

0:04:58.840,0:05:01.669
the corrections i think

0:05:01.669,0:05:05.929
not only for the plaza lobby mid-january
word

0:05:05.929,0:05:10.189
deported actually created by being
directed to something to look

0:05:10.189,0:05:13.690
it's called obvious into the inver

0:05:13.690,0:05:16.479
made some changes to probe for the
project

0:05:16.479,0:05:18.930
invested a lot in zero eighty six

0:05:18.930,0:05:21.650
that and i love you to use it

0:05:21.650,0:05:25.470
because that means that i decided but
it's important features i decided at

0:05:25.470,0:05:26.590
that point it

0:05:26.590,0:05:29.459
and admitted back into dizzy rolled

0:05:29.459,0:05:32.030
speedy sixty four which is a five-day

0:05:32.030,0:05:33.199
and did

0:05:33.199,0:05:37.369
it has never been release it publicly
needs only to the second passing

0:05:37.369,0:05:38.260
rhetoric

0:05:38.260,0:05:40.360
what is actually included in this

0:05:40.360,0:05:41.399
distribution

0:05:41.399,0:05:45.580
so in the coming days if you want to try
this this is the only way you can do

0:05:45.580,0:05:47.309
single-handedly

0:05:47.309,0:05:51.789
now how does this work uh... you won't
find red

0:05:51.789,0:05:55.490
and uh... much other than for what we
will have some

0:05:55.490,0:05:57.750
transcriptional for example

0:05:57.750,0:06:02.169
they uh... ruined examples directory
that's open this is great

0:06:02.169,0:06:06.129
uh... i'm not really interested in the
in the index who wasn't there what i

0:06:06.129,0:06:10.380
would like to write the is that uh...
justified or

0:06:10.380,0:06:14.289
religious you can see the highlighting
and for few consider highlighting the

0:06:14.289,0:06:16.429
treaty bronco services black and

0:06:16.429,0:06:17.250
it's red

0:06:17.250,0:06:20.419
it doesn't recognize that we are talking
about the defined or

0:06:20.419,0:06:21.379
and variable

0:06:21.379,0:06:25.090
so we have to enabled the this into a
new sense of a highlighter

0:06:25.090,0:06:27.660
they could do it is to go to the tools
they need

0:06:27.660,0:06:32.250
that preference has said we don't have a
checkbox for next year as far as well

0:06:32.250,0:06:35.259
so they go to the exact costa fills the
air

0:06:35.259,0:06:37.349
week and driving

0:06:37.349,0:06:39.910
singularity store but i can

0:06:39.910,0:06:41.970
and then we met here is the menu option

0:06:41.970,0:06:45.279
and as you can see is full so by default
it doesn't

0:06:45.279,0:06:48.949
it's not used to uh... turn it on the
receving true

0:06:48.949,0:06:52.809
stands up and down the still looking for
a because you need to

0:06:52.809,0:06:54.120
restart bobbitt

0:06:54.120,0:06:56.139
in order for this fare

0:06:56.139,0:06:58.069
specific features of the contract

0:06:58.069,0:07:00.909
so i close survived and uh...

0:07:00.909,0:07:04.169
story the game in the same way

0:07:04.169,0:07:05.109
and uh...

0:07:05.109,0:07:08.529
wants to open so i think this feature
that doesn't remember dinner that

0:07:08.529,0:07:09.329
correct

0:07:09.329,0:07:12.009
that the same financials video from the
wording

0:07:12.009,0:07:15.590
so i go to recent files and then i
opened the that fire

0:07:15.590,0:07:16.860
and this is an issue

0:07:16.860,0:07:19.039
girys ordeal

0:07:19.039,0:07:20.780
doing this in this kind of incorrectly

0:07:20.780,0:07:24.639
by very few also convinced that the
added a little bit

0:07:24.639,0:07:27.159
lost father for i've been

0:07:27.159,0:07:29.020
before you close it

0:07:29.020,0:07:31.360
go to the tools preferences again

0:07:31.360,0:07:33.930
and fewer there's going to follow the
same thing

0:07:33.930,0:07:36.520
and theory out that's what it says so
you can

0:07:36.520,0:07:38.429
open a new five everytime

0:07:38.429,0:07:41.919
daniel compartment but he concedes that
it too lost

0:07:41.919,0:07:44.029
issues and the last files that have been

0:07:44.029,0:07:46.460
open borders or secession management dot

0:07:46.460,0:07:49.979
i want to move into this now because
that's not the

0:07:49.979,0:07:51.879
love to hear from google

0:07:51.879,0:07:54.889
and anyway so that's a that's ahead of
the team

0:07:54.889,0:07:56.660
next feature of five ml

0:07:56.660,0:08:00.389
and that is convenient to you to greg
stevens and i think so welcome to both

0:08:00.389,0:08:01.659
lifetime

0:08:01.659,0:08:04.669
that's great

0:08:04.669,0:08:07.990
so what are the standard of other
features that signal back to this

0:08:07.990,0:08:10.409
website because it has

0:08:10.409,0:08:14.860
explanations of what kind of sense or a
new let's go to the resource so i can

0:08:14.860,0:08:17.009
remember we just

0:08:17.009,0:08:22.259
uh... seeger reporters have a reporter
and the this module take time to get out

0:08:22.259,0:08:23.840
uh... articles

0:08:23.840,0:08:27.310
uh... one of the side of the tools to a
million to report

0:08:27.310,0:08:28.909
the sender

0:08:28.909,0:08:32.620
test reports students even faster so
distressed side

0:08:32.620,0:08:34.730
probably you know this is the steven
testers

0:08:34.730,0:08:37.570
reports website there are people who

0:08:37.570,0:08:41.370
install supermodels and decide to send
all the reporters

0:08:41.370,0:08:46.550
the reports are collected in this this
place and independence even then

0:08:46.550,0:08:48.580
so we don't usually song

0:08:48.580,0:08:53.680
uh... you have to in installed there is
no deals with these are oregonians is

0:08:53.680,0:08:54.540
rich in

0:08:54.540,0:08:55.960
and you have to

0:08:55.960,0:08:59.490
called secure pizza is suing to send-off

0:08:59.490,0:09:04.019
in your view to return home and to send
out in faith in your name

0:09:04.019,0:09:07.030
so if you go to the cbo investors forgot
side

0:09:07.030,0:09:09.630
and the scroll down and there is a

0:09:09.630,0:09:15.130
or people become a decir which links to
the bikini and day i don't go into the

0:09:15.130,0:09:17.110
details now that's gonna be a separate

0:09:17.110,0:09:18.700
has been destroyed

0:09:18.700,0:09:22.880
but you can go there and then delete
uh... water skied off and then you can

0:09:22.880,0:09:27.120
start sending out that supports ridge's

0:09:27.120,0:09:31.940
what else they only have so text csc
access distribute says that need a ride

0:09:31.940,0:09:34.100
city fathers that's so that

0:09:34.100,0:09:37.670
in case you want to contact to uh... an
institution unix machines

0:09:37.670,0:09:38.350
or

0:09:38.350,0:09:41.190
there are always wrong first and uh...

0:09:41.190,0:09:43.130
and bridges and what not that are

0:09:43.130,0:09:46.350
you can call figure it out of ayatollah
interface

0:09:46.350,0:09:51.449
anyway because you need to use them the
forecasting go to configure histograms

0:09:51.449,0:09:54.320
naturalistic reporting format

0:09:54.320,0:09:57.820
at seven out of state of the are those
who need to

0:09:57.820,0:10:01.620
actually geoffrey schmalz wants you to
be updated to for an extra growth

0:10:01.620,0:10:02.640
seasick

0:10:02.640,0:10:06.320
and package but it can be used by anyone
that's a common lentil

0:10:06.320,0:10:07.460
facial you

0:10:07.460,0:10:08.160
what uh...

0:10:08.160,0:10:10.860
which photos are outdated in your
installation

0:10:10.860,0:10:14.460
uh... template toolkit tepid toolkit
uh...

0:10:14.460,0:10:15.680
who helped me

0:10:15.680,0:10:17.439
right uh... or

0:10:17.439,0:10:19.490
and intellectually

0:10:19.490,0:10:23.570
right uh... and more complex
applications have obligations so

0:10:23.570,0:10:26.750
