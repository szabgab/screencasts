These are the caption files in English and in various other languages
for some of the screencasts in my YouTube channel.

http://www.youtube.com/gabor529

Each screencast has its own subdirectory.
In each subdirectory you will find a file called english.sbv
which is the English caption file. It is based on the automatic
transcription that YouTube generates and then it is improved. Hopefully.

Before attempting the translation of any of the screencasts we first
have to make sure the English transcriptions are good.

Some were already manually fixed (that's indicated next to each entry),
those can already be translated.

Most of them are still the original automatic transcription.
Those need a lot of improvement before they can be used as caption.

Each translation should have its own .sbv file with the name of the
language being the filename.

The name of the translators should be added to this readme file.

If you are interested in translating any of these screencasts,
please get in contact with me so I can list you in this file.

Look at the status of each video. There are two that
already have real English subtitles and one has Russian.
All the rest need English subtitles first and once that's
done, they need the translations.


There is a script called check_timestamp.pl in the repository
that will check if all the timestamps are correctly formatted.

Run:

perl check_timestamp.pl
